# A comparison of concept drift detectors in an online learning setting 
### presented by Nadine Gabrek

This repository contains the relevant code for the execution of the experiments, which produced the relevant results for the master-thesis.
It predominantly applies the River and Frours library for the evaluation of data streams and concept drift detection methods.

## Structure of the code 
As the concept drift detection from the Frouros library are not compatible with the evaluation framework in River, minor adaptions of the respective 
Code from the aforementioned libraries was necessary. The adapted classes are in the directoried 'frouros_adapted' and 'river_adapted', respecitvely, where each adaption is marked by a explainatory comment.

The code for the data stream generators for the synthetic datasets as well as the real-world datasets are included in the directory 'datasets' as they cannot directly be loaded from a package but require further specification. 

The directory 'evaluation' included the code for the evaluation set-up, in addition to the statistical tests that are used to compare the experimental results

In 'utils' different utility methods, e.g., for the reading and writing of the results from and into csv-files or for the computation of the confidence intervals of the results. 

The main directory, which contains all the code for the specific experiments is called 'experiments'. It additional includes the corresponding sh-file for the execution on the bwUniCluster 2.0 and the respective output files from the experiments already executed in the course of this thesis work. 

The two remaining directories 'results' and 'plot' simply include all the results generated by the experiments as well as the CD graphs created with the Nemenyi test.

Additional code files in the overarching directory contain the code for the post-hoc statistical test as well as further small test conducted in the course of this work.

## Instruction for the executing of the experiments
1. Because the experiments were processed on the bwUniCluster 2.0, no main file was used to execute the individual experiments. Instead, batch jobs were executed which ran the respective Python file.
Therefore, we suggest running the commands in corresponding sh-file in the consol in order for the code to be executed without errors. When the code is run, potential errors based on mismatched dependencies are possible.

2. When all experiments were executed, the Python file 'create_final_conf_results.py' in the overarching directory must be run, such that the confidence interval of the results over the repeted executions on the synthetic datasets as well as the BOLE classifier and KSWIN detector are computed. 

3. Finally, the files for the Nemenyi test, which also are located in the overarching directory, must be executed to obtain the results on the comparison in form of CD graphs on the average ranks of the detection methods.

## Packages
Here is the list of all packages implemented in the used conda environment on the bwUniCluster 2.0, where the most important ones are highlighted.
